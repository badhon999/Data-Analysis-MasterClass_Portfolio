The visualizations show that earthquake activity is heavily concentrated along the India–Bangladesh and India–Myanmar border regions, where both the frequency and magnitude of events are highest.

1. Earthquake activity is concentrated along the India–Bangladesh and India–Myanmar borders.

2. India records the highest number of earthquakes, showing strong regional seismic activity.

3. Border regions also show significant frequency and intensity of events.

4. Magnitude over time is mostly stable but has notable spikes in the 1950s, 1980s, and 2000s.

5. Seismic risk is clustered in predictable geographic zones.

The dashboard shows that Myanmar experiences the highest concentration and total magnitude of earthquakes, indicating it is the primary seismic hotspot in the dataset. Magnitude values consistently fall between 5.0 and 6.2, reflecting moderate but impactful seismic activity.

1. Myanmar shows the highest concentration and total magnitude of earthquakes.

2. Most earthquake magnitudes range between 5.0 and 6.2.

3. Magnitude over time appears steady, with no extreme long-term spikes.

4. The visuals help identify key risk areas and support data-driven planning and preparation.
